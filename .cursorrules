# ng2-pdfjs-viewer Project Rules

## Rule 1: Always Use test.bat for Testing
- NEVER run individual commands like `npm run build` or `ng serve`
- ALWAYS use `./test.bat` for complete build â†’ publish â†’ update â†’ install â†’ run workflow

## Rule 2: Verify BUILD_ID Before Debugging
- ALWAYS check console logs for BUILD_ID before analyzing any issues
- Expected BUILD_ID logs:
  - `ðŸŸ¢ ng2-pdfjs-viewer.component.ts: TEST LOG - BUILD_ID: [timestamp]`
  - `ðŸŸ¢ postmessage-wrapper.js: TEST LOG - BUILD_ID: [timestamp]`
- If BUILD_ID logs are missing:
  1. Stop debugging immediately (old code is running)
  2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
  3. Clear yalc cache if needed
  4. Re-run test.bat and verify BUILD_ID logs appear
  5. Only then proceed with debugging

## Rule 3: Follow PDF.js v4.x Standards
- Adhere 100% to PDF.js v4.x standards and APIs
- Avoid fragile implementations
- Use event-driven architecture, no timeout-based hacks

## Rule 4: Avoid Code Bloat
- Don't add unnecessary code or content
- Keep implementations clean and focused
