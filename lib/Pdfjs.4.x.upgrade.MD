Let's leave sample app for now. It is easy to rewrite from scratch.
Let's leave live demo as well. Plan is to rewrite.

- Why was ng-packagr added as dev dependency ?
- Assuming shx works on windows as well. New to this.
- PDF's are loaded inside an iframe. Does document.addEventListner() gets fired even if we use iframe?
There are two scenarios. PDF can be embedded in html or opened in a new window.
- I like the way pdfjs's event bus is used. In the beginning I had to hack pdfjs library pdfjs library to send those browser events. :-)



Thought for community - How about starting a discord server for ng2-pdfjs-viewer ?
