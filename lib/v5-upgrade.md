## v4.x Upgrade History (Previously Completed)

## Development Rules

### Rule 1: Always Use test.bat for Testing

**CRITICAL**: For all testing and development work, **ALWAYS use the `test.bat` file**. This is a mandatory rule for this project.

**Why this rule exists:**
- Ensures consistent build process across all developers
- Automates the complete workflow: build → publish → update → install → run
- Prevents manual errors in the development process
- Guarantees that you're testing with the latest code changes
- Maintains proper dependency management through yalc

**To build the library and run the SampleApp:**

```sh
./test.bat
```

This script will:
- Build the `lib` package
- Publish it to yalc
- Update the SampleApp to use the latest build
- Install dependencies in SampleApp
- Start the SampleApp for testing

**Note**: The SampleApp is used for demonstration and testing purposes. It showcases the library's capabilities and provides a reference implementation for developers integrating the ng2-pdfjs-viewer library into their own applications. **SampleApp demonstrates how a real consumer would use the library** - it imports the module, configures the component, and uses only the public API without any special privileges or internal access.

**Never manually run individual commands** like `npm run build` or `ng serve` in isolation. Always use `test.bat` to ensure the complete workflow is followed.

---

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis and upgrade path for migrating ng2-pdfjs-viewer from its current PDF.js version to v4.x. The project is an Angular wrapper around Mozilla's PDF.js viewer that provides enhanced functionality through custom modifications to the viewer files.

**Important Note**: The `SampleApp` directory is a demonstration application that showcases the capabilities of the ng2-pdfjs-viewer library. It serves as a reference implementation and testing environment for the library's features. **SampleApp should work exactly like any consumer of the library** - it uses the public API, follows the same integration patterns, and demonstrates real-world usage scenarios. Detailed implementation details, technical specifications, and internal workings are documented within the `lib` directory, which contains the actual library code and comprehensive documentation.

## Environment
I am on a windows machine. So bash scripts may not work. Windows terminal and powershell are available.

2. **Event System**: Enhanced event bus with new event types
3. **Configuration**: New configuration system with AppOptions
4. **API Changes**: Significant changes to PDFViewerApplication API
5. **Build System**: New build process and file structure

### Key Changes in viewer.mjs

#### 1. Query Parameter Parsing
```javascript
// Current implementation (v4.x)
function parseQueryString(query) {
  const params = new Map();
  for (const [key, value] of new URLSearchParams(query)) {
    params.set(key.toLowerCase(), value);
  }
  return params;
}
```

#### 2. Event System
```javascript
// New event types in v4.x
- "pagesloaded" - When all pages are loaded

```

## Upgrade Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Update Angular component to v4.x event system
- ✅ Modify query parameter parsing
- ✅ Update PDFViewerApplication access patterns
- ✅ Test basic PDF loading functionality

### Phase 2: Dynamic Control System via External PostMessage Wrapper ✅ COMPLETED

#### 2.1 Problem Analysis ✅ RESOLVED
**Current Limitation**: Controls and modes are only set on initial iframe load via query parameters. Dynamic changes to Angular inputs have no effect on the PDF.js viewer after load.

**Root Cause**: The PDF.js viewer is isolated in an iframe and only reads its configuration on initial load. There is no live communication channel between the Angular component and the viewer.

#### 2.2 Solution: External PostMessage Wrapper Architecture ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Approach**: Create a separate JavaScript wrapper file that communicates with the PDF.js viewer without modifying `viewer.mjs`.

**Architecture**:
```
Angular Component ←→ postMessage API ←→ External Wrapper ←→ PDF.js Viewer (iframe)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Upgrade-safe**: `viewer.mjs` remains unmodified
- ✅ **Feature-complete**: Supports all README.md features
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Custom code is isolated and well-structured
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Existing query parameter approach continues to work
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Easy to add new features and modify behavior

   - Input change detection and message dispatch
   - Response handling and error management

3. **HTML Integration**
   - Include wrapper script in viewer.html
   - Ensure proper loading order

### Phase 3: 100% Event-Driven Architecture ✅ COMPLETED

#### 3.1 Event-Driven Approach Overview
**Philosophy**: Eliminate all timeout-based hacks, polling, and retry mechanisms in favor of pure event-driven communication.

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ **No setTimeout/setInterval**: All timing handled via events
- ✅ **No polling**: State changes detected via event listeners
- ✅ **No retry loops**: Actions execute when conditions are met
- ✅ **No timeout fallbacks**: System relies on actual events
- ✅ **Immediate execution**: Actions run as soon as readiness is achieved

#### 3.2 Readiness State Management System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**5-Level Readiness Hierarchy**:
```javascript
const ViewerReadiness = {
  NOT_LOADED: 0,           // PDFViewerApplication doesn't exist
  VIEWER_LOADED: 1,        // PDFViewerApplication exists
  VIEWER_INITIALIZED: 2,   // PDFViewerApplication.initialized = true
  EVENTBUS_READY: 3,       // Event bus is available and ready
  COMPONENTS_READY: 4,     // All required components available
  DOCUMENT_LOADED: 5       // PDF document fully loaded
};
```

**Event-Driven State Transitions**:
1. **DOM Observation**: `MutationObserver` detects when PDFViewerApplication becomes available
2. **Promise-Based Initialization**: Uses `PDFViewerApplication.initializedPromise.then()` for async initialization
3. **Custom Events**: Readiness state changes emit custom events
4. **Event Listeners**: Components listen for specific events rather than polling
5. **Immediate Execution**: Actions execute as soon as conditions are met

#### 3.3 Action Classification System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Action Types Based on Readiness Requirements**:
```javascript
const IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS = [
  'show-download', 'show-print', 'show-fullscreen', 'show-find', 
  'show-bookmark', 'show-openfile', 'show-annotations',
  'set-error-message', 'set-error-override', 'set-error-append', 
  'set-locale', 'set-css-zoom'
]; // Execute when PostMessage API is ready (readiness >= 3)

const VIEWER_READY_ACTIONS = [
  'set-cursor', 'set-scroll', 'set-spread', 'set-zoom',
  'update-page-mode'
]; // Execute when components are ready (readiness >= 4)

const DOCUMENT_LOADED_ACTIONS = [
  'set-page', 'set-rotation', 'go-to-last-page', 'go-to-named-dest',
  'trigger-download', 'trigger-print', 'trigger-rotate-cw', 'trigger-rotate-ccw'
]; // Execute after PDF loads (readiness >= 5)
```

#### 3.4 Enhanced Action Queue Management ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Three Separate Queues**:
```typescript
class ActionQueueManager {
  private immediateActions: ViewerAction[] = [];      // Execute when PostMessage API is ready
  private viewerReadyActions: ViewerAction[] = [];   // Execute when components are ready
  private documentLoadedActions: ViewerAction[] = []; // Execute after PDF loads
  private pendingActions: ViewerAction[] = [];       // On-demand actions
}
```

**Event-Driven Execution**:
- Actions queue based on readiness requirements
- Execute immediately when appropriate readiness level is reached
- No delays, retries, or timeout-based waiting
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 3.5 Component Availability Verification ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Async Initialization Awareness**:
```javascript
function verifyComponentAvailability(action) {
  const app = PDFViewerApplication;
  if (!app) return false;
  
  // Check if viewer is properly initialized
  if (!app.initialized && !app.initializedPromise) {
    log(`Component verification failed: PDFViewerApplication not initialized for action: ${action}`, 'warn');
    return false;
  }
  
  // Action-specific component checks...
}
```

**Action-Specific Validation**:
- Cursor actions: Check for `pdfCursorTools` or `eventBus`
- Scroll/Spread/Zoom: Check for `pdfViewer`
- Page navigation: Check for `pdfViewer` and `pdfDocument`
- Auto actions: Check for `pdfDocument`

#### 3.6 Event-Driven Communication Flow ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**PostMessage Wrapper Initialization**:
1. **DOM Observation**: `MutationObserver` detects PDFViewerApplication availability
2. **Async Initialization**: Waits for `initializedPromise` to resolve
3. **Event Bus Verification**: Checks `eventBus.dispatch` availability
4. **Component Verification**: Validates required components
5. **API Initialization**: Sets up PostMessage API when ready
6. **Ready Notification**: Sends `postmessage-ready` event to Angular component

**Angular Component Integration**:
1. **Event Listener**: Listens for `postmessage-ready` notification
2. **Readiness Tracking**: Updates internal readiness state
3. **Action Execution**: Executes queued actions based on readiness
4. **Change Buffering**: Handles changes that occur before readiness
5. **Event Bus Binding**: Binds to PDF.js events for state synchronization

#### 3.7 Eliminated Timeout-Based Patterns ✅ COMPLETED

**Removed Patterns**:
- ❌ `setTimeout` polling for PDFViewerApplication existence
- ❌ `setTimeout` polling for readiness changes
- ❌ `setTimeout` for PostMessage API readiness
- ❌ `setTimeout` for message response handling

## Building and Running the Project

**RULE**: **ALWAYS use the `test.bat` script for building the library and running the SampleApp.**

- To build and test the latest changes:

```sh
./test.bat
```

This will ensure the library is rebuilt, published, and the SampleApp is updated and started with the latest code.

**Remember**: Never run individual commands like `npm run build` or `ng serve` in isolation. Always use `test.bat` to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

**Note**: The SampleApp serves as both a testing environment for the library and a demonstration of its capabilities. It provides examples of how to integrate the ng2-pdfjs-viewer library into Angular applications and showcases all available features and configuration options. **By treating SampleApp as a consumer of the library**, we ensure that the library's public API is well-designed, comprehensive, and meets real-world usage requirements.

### Migration Success

The upgrade successfully maintains the extensive feature set that makes ng2-pdfjs-viewer valuable while leveraging the improvements in PDF.js v4.x. The event-driven approach ensures a smooth transition for users of the library and provides a solid foundation for future development.

**The key to success was the systematic elimination of timeout-based patterns in favor of pure event-driven communication, resulting in a more reliable, performant, and maintainable system.**
